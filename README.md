# Practice Problems Repository

Welcome to my Practice Problems repository! This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like **LeetCode** and **CodeSignal**.

## Structure

- Each directory corresponds to a specific platform (e.g., `LeetCode/`, `CodeSignal/`).
- Within each directory, problems are organized by topic or difficulty level.
- Each solution includes a `.js` file with the code and, where necessary, a brief explanation or comments on the approach used.

## Goals

- Enhance problem-solving skills.
- Master key algorithms and data structures.
- Prepare for coding interviews.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the solutions. Each problem file is named according to the problem title or description for easy reference. If you find a solution helpful or have suggestions for improvement, you're welcome to contribute or reach out!

Happy coding!
